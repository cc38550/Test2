# Description

In this project, I created five issues (each with a separate branch to be merged with the main branch). For each issue, the corresponding branch was edited in Eclipse to include a Test case for a block of code. When the Test case was updated, I pushed the changes to GitHub and merged the branch created for the issue into the main branch via pull request.
